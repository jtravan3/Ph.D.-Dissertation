	abstract = {This paper explains the building of robust software using multiagent reputation. One of the major goals of software engineering is to achieve robust software. Our hypothesis is that robustness can be increased through redundancy. We achieve redundancy by using agents, with each agent wrapping a different algorithm with similar functionality. The agents build trust in each other using reinforcement learning. Two types of reputation management are simulated: one in which the reputations of all agents are maintained centrally and a second, which is distributed, where an agent maintains locally the reputations of the agents it knows and each agent can have its own evaluation of its known agents' performances. We simulated and compared two ways of achieving distributed reputation management. A probabilistic function is used as a preprocessing technique for selecting a set of agents based on reinforcement values of the agents. The values are obtained based on the correctness of the results the agent produces in performing the task it is given. Voting is used as a postprocessing technique for judging the correctness of the output generated by the agents.},

	abstract = {QoS-based service selection mechanisms will play an essential role in service-oriented architectures, as e-business applications want to use services that most accurately meet their requirements. However, current techniques provide no support for actually making rational selections. In this paper, we develop a multiagent framework for QoS-based Web services selection, through a combination of the respective merits of agent and service-oriented to enables dynamic and efficient delivery of composite Web services. We present a service-oriented distributed reputation assessment algorithm as a QoS support module in the framework. We give an example application and some preliminary results},

However, user transactions can be flawed and lead to inconsistent (or invalid) states. Database systems usually correct invalid data using "point in time" recovery, a costly process that installs a backup and rolls it forward. The result is long outages and the "de-commit" of many valid transactions, which must then be re-submitted, frequently manually. We have implemented in our transaction-time database system a technique in which only data tainted by a flawed transaction and transactions dependent upon its updates are "removed". This process identifies and quarantines tainted data despite the complication of determining transactions dependent on data written by the flawed transaction. A further property of our implementation is that no backup needs to be installed for this because the prior transaction-time states provide an online backup.},

In order to make the composite service adapt to such dynamic property of Web services, we propose a self-healing approach for web service composition. Such an approach is an integration of backing up in selection and reselecting in execution. In order to make the composite service heal itself as quickly as possible and minimize the number of reselections, a way of performance prediction is proposed in this paper. On this basis, the self-healing approach is presented including framework, the triggering algorithm of the reselection and the reliability model of the service. Experiments show that the proposed solutions have better performance in supporting the self-healing Web service composition.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the problem of providing long-running web service transactions that maintain consistency, high availability, and durability. Long running transactions involve human interaction as activities in the transaction. The human interaction increases the latency of the overall transaction. Implementation options are considered for managing limited resources held by a transaction that contain two or more web service requests separated by human interaction. In our previous work, we proposed a replica update propagation method called the Buddy System, which guaranteed consistency, durability and higher availability of web services. The previous work studied transactions composed of a single coarse-grained request. In this paper, the Buddy System is extended to allow long-running transactions comprising two or more web-service calls separated by human interaction.},

	abstract = {Electronic business processing has drastically grown since the advent of the World Wide Web. As transaction processing is at the heart of business processing, many companies have been interested in transaction processing on the Web. However, little attention has been paid to supporting consistent transaction processing on the Web, while most works have focused on performance enhancement, processing multiple HTTP requests in a single context, and scalability. This paper identifies three consistency problems in processing transactions on the Web and proposes solutions for each problem. These are based on cookie logging, Web page logging, and storing information for unilaterally aborted transactions. Some of the proposed ideas have been implemented in a Web transaction processing system, WebTP. We believe that they can be also applied to any other Web transaction processing system of similar architecture.},

	abstract = {Building mission critical applications and services (e.g. e-commerce) using process-oriented approaches has had successes and difficulties. These applications automated successfully the important frequent cases such as purchases, but the code needed for handling exceptions such as cancellations and failures tend to grow to disproportionate size and complexity. These difficulties lead to non-automated and expensive solutions such as call centers, which resolve data inconsistency problems manually. In this paper we describe the WED-flow (work, event, and data-flow) approach, which provides transactional recovery through incremental evolution of exception handling, by combining the concepts of advanced transaction models, events, and data states. By carefully recording the detailed data states of each execution step, WED-flow composes backward and forward recovery mechanisms as reusable exception handling services to preserve the consistency of all databases involved in the application with well-defined correctness properties. A practical application of the automated recovery in WED-flow is the real-time recovery of failed cases for mission-critical applications and services.},

We formally prove that our solution guarantees consistent execution history of concurrent web transactions and increases concurrency and performance over traditional locking methods. We developed a simulation using a multi-threaded approach. We generated sample workloads of simulated concurrent transactions over seven tests. Our results show that the solution works comparatively with traditional locking and no-locking solutions with the added benefit of ensured consistency in some cases and deadlock avoidance in others.},

If conspirators produce those conflicts intentionally, they can establish the unexpected communication path called covert channel between high security level users and low security level users.

Kogan (both in Proc. 1990 IEEE Symp. on Res. In Security \& Privacy, May 1990). In the latter, each security level has a container that holds a copy of all lower-level data. It is shown that only a constant number of old copies (two, as it turns out) must be maintained. The correctness of the algorithm is argued, and it is demonstrated that the algorithm is free of indirect channels and starvation.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

Such real-time systems are typically contained in environments that exhibit hierarchical propagation of information, where mandatory access control for security is required. Conventional multi-level secure database models that implement mandatory access control are inadequate for time-critical applications and conventional real-time database models do not address security constraints. The objective of this work is to incorporate security constraints in real-time database systems in such a way that not only is security achieved, but achieving security does not degrade real-time performance significantly in terms of deadlines missed. We present concurrency control algorithm for secure real-time databases that the Secure OPT algorithm uses the properties of an optimistic concurrency protocol. We implement the algorithm and study their performance using a real-time database system simulation model. Our study covers both soft and firm real-time databases. Results show that the algorithm performs fairly well in terms of security and timeliness compared to a non-secure algorithm. We argue and show that achieving more security does not necessarily mean more sacrifice in real-time performance.},

This is because EP requires that read locks are not released by a participant during their window of uncertainty; however, it is not possible for a locking protocol to provide this guarantee in a MLS system (since the read lock of a higher-level transaction on a lower-level data object must be released whenever a lower-level transaction wants to write the same data). The only available work in the literature, namely the Secure Early Prepare (SEP) protocol, overcomes this difficulty by aborting those distributed transactions that release their low-level read locks prematurely. We see this approach as being too restrictive. One of the major benefits of distributed processing is its robustness to failures, and SEP fails to take advantage of this. In this paper, we propose the Advanced Secure Early Prepare (ASEP) commit protocol to solve the above problem, together with a number of language primitives that can be used as system calls in distributed transactions. These primitives permit features like partial rollback and forward recovery to be incorporated within the transaction model, and allow a distributed transaction to proceed even when a participant has released its low-level read locks prematurely. This not only offers flexibility, but can also be used, if desired, by a sophisticated programmer to trade off consistency for atomicity of the distributed transaction.},

	abstract = {We address security in object-oriented database systems for multilevel secure environments. Such an environment consists of users cleared to various security levels, accessing information labeled with varying classifications. Our purpose is three-fold. First, we show how security can be naturally incorporated into the object model of computing so as to form a foundation for building multilevel secure object-oriented database management systems. Next, we show how such an abstract security model can be realized under a cost-effective, viable, and popular security architecture. Finally, we give security arguments based on trusted subjects and a formal proof to demonstrate the confidentiality of our architecture and approach. A notable feature of our solution is the support for secure synchronous write-up operations. This is useful when low level users want to send information to higher level users. In the object-oriented context, this is naturally modeled and efficiently accomplished through write-up messages sent by low level subjects. However, such write-up messages can pose confidentiality leaks (through timing and signaling channels) if the timing of the receipt and processing of the messages is observable to lower level senders. Such covert channels are a formidable obstacle in building high-assurance secure systems. Further, solutions to problems such as these have been known to involve various tradeoffs between confidentiality, integrity, and performance. We present a concurrent computation model that closes such channels while preserving the conflicting goals of confidentiality, integrity, and performance. Finally, we give a confidentiality proof for a trusted subject architecture and implementation and demonstrate that the trusted subject (process) cannot leak information in violation of multilevel security.},

In this paper, we show that these concepts can be captured in a F-logic style declarative query language, called MultiLog, for MLS deductive databases for which a model theoretic semantics exists. This development is significant from a database perspective as it now enables us to compute the semantics of MultiLog databases in a bottom-up fashion. The semantics developed here is reminiscent of the stable model semantics of logic programs with negation. We also define a bottom-up procedure to compute unique models of stratified MultiLog databases. Finally, we also establish the equivalence of MultiLog’s three logical characterizations — model theory, fixpoint theory and proof theory.},

Concurrent transactions on MLS/DBMS potentially have conflicts while accessing the shared data. The conflicts result in some of the conflicting transactions to be delayed. If the delayed transactions have been cleared at low security level, an information may flow downward with the violation of security policy. This kind of communication channel is called covert channel.Several transaction scheduling schemes for solving the covert channel problem had been presented. Although they had solved the covert channel problem, unfortunately, they had left alone other kinds of security problems, such as the availability and the integrity problems. Since computer security consists of maintaining the confidentiality, the availability, and the integrity, an attempt to acquire every characteristic is necessary.Tightly secure transaction scheduler, presented in this paper, schedules concurrent transactions without loss of the characteristics of security. For the confidentiality and the availability, the philosophy of the scheduler is based on the concealment of uncommitted data. Besides, for the integrity, a trustworthiness together with a recentness of a data are considered for discriminating the appropriateness of the data.},

Concurrency control is an integral part of database systems. Secure concurrency control algorithms [15,17,18,29,] proposed in literature achieve correctness and security at the cost of declined performance of high security level transactions. These algorithms infringe the fairness in processing transactions at different security levels. Though the performance of different concurrency control algorithms have been explored extensively for centralized multilevel secure database management systems [11,31] but to the best of author’s knowledge the relative performance of transactions at different security levels using secure concurrency control algorithm for has not been reported yet. To fill this gap, this paper presents a detailed simulation model of a multilevel secure distributed database system and investigates the performance price paid for maintaining security in a MLS/DDBMS.

A class of schedulers called output-state-equivalent is identified for which another criterion implies DC-security. The criterion considers separately the behavior of the scheduler in response to those inputs that cause rollback and those that do not.

Transactions are vital for multilevel secure database management systems (MLS/DBMSs) because they provide transparency to concurrency and to failure. Concurrent execution of transactions may lead to contention among subjects for access to data, which in MLS/DBMSs may lead to security problems.

Necessary and sufficient conditions are developed for DC-Security in this framework and proved using noninterference. A wide range of schedulers is evaluated against these conditions.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

Reputation systems should be based on rules that can guarantee high level of trust and help identify unreliable units. To understand the effectiveness of dynamic properties in the evaluation of reputation, we propose our own model (DIB-RM) that utilizes three factors: forgetting, cumulative, and activity period. In order to evaluate the model, we use data from StackOverflow which also has its own reputation model. We estimate similarity of ratings between DIB-RM and the StackOverflow reputation model to test our hypothesis. We use two values to calculate our metrics: DIB-RM reputation and historical reputation. We found out that historical reputation gives better metric values. Our preliminary results are presented for different sets of values of the aforementioned factors in order to analyze how effectively the model can be used for modeling reputation systems.},

	abstract = {A computational grid is a distributed infrastructure that appears to the end user as one large computing resource across organization boundaries. Grid technologies enable large-scale sharing of resources within formal or informal consortia of individuals and/or institutions, usually called virtual organizations. In these settings, the discovery, characterization, management, and monitoring of resources, services, and computations can be challenging due to the considerable diversity, large numbers, dynamic behavior, and geographical distribution of the entities in which a user might be interested. Trust is one of the biggest concerns in the grid resource management field. Grid systems can employ reputation mechanisms in order to provide this essential trust, but not usually without incurring in certain additional costs that negate the potential performance gains offered by grid computing technologies. Moreover, current reputation mechanisms are not appropriate for resource management in large-scale systems. In this paper, we present a new reputation model for resource management based on a economy model. Also we demonstrate how it can by employed to add trust into algorithms for grid scheduling. Finally, we simulate the proposed resource management algorithm in order to verify its effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Nodes in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are mandated to utilize their limited energy resources in forwarding routing control and data packets for other nodes. Since a MANET lacks a centralized administration and control, a node may decide to act selfishly by not responding to route requests from other nodes or deceitfully by responding to some route requests but dropping the corresponding data packet that is presented for forwarding. A significant increase in the presence of these misbehaving nodes in a MANET can subsequently degrade network performance. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Reputation Management System for detecting and isolating misbehaving nodes in MANETs. Our model employs a novel direct monitoring technique to evaluate the reputation of a node in the network which ensures that nodes that expend their energy in transmitting data and routing control packets for others are allowed to carry out their network activities while the misbehaving nodes are detected and isolated from the network. Simulation results show that our model is effective in curbing and mitigating the effects of misbehaving nodes in the network.},

In RATM, the metric of time zone is used to describe the time property of the transaction experiences and recommendations; the peer trust value, the short trust value and the long trust value are applied to express accurately the final trust level of peers. Moreover, the trust deviation value and the trust abuse value are introduced to depict the above several trust metrics. Theoretical analyses and simulation experiments demonstrates that, RATM has advantages in combating various dynamic malicious behaviors such as dishonest feedbacks and strategic malicious attacks, over the current trust model, and shows more effectiveness and stronger dynamic adaptability.},

However, when these applications are modelled as unstructured distributed systems, the greater autonomy and decentralization encourage antisocial behaviours, which are likely to cause performance degradation for the whole system. This paper presents a fully distributed reputation management system that allows the evaluation of agent reputation in unstructured environments without any centralized coordination. The proposed approach is based on game theory and is capable of capturing the highly dynamic nature of the involved communities. As a representative example of an unstructured environment, peer-to-peer (P2P) networks are considered. Those dynamic communities are affected by several antisocial behaviours, such as free riding. Since this phenomenon typically causes and exacerbates an unbalanced and unfair use of system resources, it has been considered as the case study in our work. The proposed solution exploits peer reputations in order to define an incentive system, whose main goal is the dissuasion from free riding.},

In a commercial transaction, it is necessary to present reputation values of web services in a timely and a robust manner so as to counter the unfair ratings of malicious users. To address the time lag problem, most popular web sites use an averaging algorithm with fixed sliding windows, window size is constant and older ratings are dropped upon the arrival of new ratings. Herein, we propose a dynamic sliding window model that is capable of reflecting the reputation values yielded by the latest changes in services. Furthermore, we implement a statistical strategy to filter out unfair ratings by calculating the standard deviation of the ratings after transposing the two-dimensional linear window into the constant one-dimensional window by using linear regression. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model, it outperforms the existing reputation system by 40\% on average based on the 5 test cases examined, and also show that it can asymptotically converge to the underlying reputation value as ratings accumulate.},

	abstract = {Reputation systems provide an important basis for judging whether to interact with others in a networked system. Designing such systems is especially interesting in decentralized environments such as mobile ad-hoc networks, as there is no trusted authority to manage reputation feedback information. Such systems also come with significant privacy concerns, further complicating the issue. Researchers have proposed privacy-preserving decentralized reputation systems (PDRS) which ensure individual reputation information is not leaked. Instead, aggregate information is exposed. Unfortunately, in existing PDRS, when a party leaves the network, all of the reputation information they possess about other parties in the network leaves too. This is a significant problem when applying such systems to the kind of dynamic networks we see in mobile computing. In this article, we introduce dynamic, privacy-preserving reputation systems (Dyn-PDRS) to solve the problem. We enumerate the features that a reputation system must support in order to be considered a Dyn-PDRS. Furthermore, we present protocols to enable these features and describe how our protocols are composed to form a Dyn-PDRS. We present simulations of our ideas to understand how a Dyn-PDRS impacts information availability in the network, and report on an implementation of our protocols, including timing experiments.},

The DRMPR system can achieve self-study from a large amount of data and feedback, and with the system obtaining a plenty of resources, the judgment is more accurate. At the end of the paper, an experimental project has been built to demonstrate that the DRMPR can provide a unified management of the reputation degree of the resource provides and users accurately.},

A kind of long-term incentive mechanism based on implicit reputation factor was presented to improve construction market environment, to coordinate organization relationships and to prevent the deputypsilas moral hazard. The game theory and principal agent theory were applied to analyze effect of reputation incentive mechanism in the construction industry. A two-stage dynamic incentive contract model integrating implicit reputation incentive mechanism with explicit revenue incentive mechanism was established. Through analyzing influencing factors of reputation incentive effect and comparative analysis with explicit incentive mechanism without considering implicit reputation factor, conditions of effective equilibrium and Pareto improvement of the two partiespsila revenue for the reputation incentive mechanism were obtained. A numerical study also testified validity of the model.},

The results reflects that, whether the linear relationship between duration and quality exists or not, the project management enterprise resorting to adjust project object objective incentive intensity and implementing reputation incentive strategy could not only achieve project value-adding maximization, but also realize net earnings Pareto improvement between project management enterprise and contractor.},

	abstract = {In open and dynamic environments, reputation-based trust is a key issue for service selection which is based on the prediction of services' performance. Typically, the trust and reputation evaluation is based on the feedback of the service quality from all service users. The crucial issue in this evaluation is to detect and deal with false or unfair feedback from dishonest providers and cheating users. In this paper, we first present a dynamic service selection framework then introduce a semantic match and rank algorithm to enable the automatic selection. Furthermore, we propose a reputation assessment approach to address trust and reputation of service and service user in various realistic cheating behaviors. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, a set of empirical studies have been conducted to demonstrate that our solution gains good results under collaboration attacks of various cheating behaviors.},

The paper gives a method for the link reputation evaluation and the reputation calculation for node, path and end-to-end. The local link reputations are broadcasted by the OSPF routing protocol, which updates link reputations dynamically. The trust policies are applied to link reputations, form the dedicated reputation forwarding table, and forward packet over secure and trusted links, nodes and paths. Comparing with static trust management, the dynamic trust management can meet the requirement of real time reputation evaluation, broadcasting and updating.},

	title = {A reputation management system for efficient selection of disaster management team},
	abstract = {Managing a disaster and emergency situation is a challenging task. Various ICT based systems like the Oasis and SAHANA have been developed to provide necessary collaboration, operational monitoring and resource sharing facilities for different phases of disaster management. As different organizations share their resources and skills in a disaster situation, the concepts related to collaborative networks become more relevant. Under such conditions, one of the issues is related to the efficient partner or team member selection as applicable in the case of collaborative networks. Although different partner selection mechanisms have been proposed in the literature of collaborative networks but considering the dynamic context of trust, these cannot be applied directly in the disaster management situation. Trust and reputation have been identified as one of the important factors for the efficient disaster management in the related literature. The current work focuses on the development of a reputation management system for efficient selection of disaster management team. For this, a framework identifies important factors having impact on the reputation and trust of a particular partner working in collaboration with other organizations, proposes a Service Oriented Architecture to extract information from information sources and finally proposes an algorithm for calculating the reputation score. The system can be applied in team formation and performance management system of various disaster management support tools.},
