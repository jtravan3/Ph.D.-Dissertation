    \begin{definition}
    \label{#1}
     (Commit Rate) - the commit rate of a transaction $T_{i}$, denoted as  $C_{r}(T_{i})$, is calculated by the given formula:
     
     \[\textrm{$\abs{c_{i}}$} = \textrm{\# of executions of $T_{i}$ ending with a COMMIT result}\]
     \[\textrm{$\abs{a_{i}}$} = \textrm{\# of executions of $T_{i}$ ending with a ABORT result}\]
     \[\textrm{$C_{r}(T_{i})$} =\frac{\textrm{$\abs{c_{i}}$}}{\textrm{$\abs{c_{i} + a_{i}}$}}\]
     
     Once this ratio is calculated, it is compared to the overall ratio of commit to abort executions for all transactions.

\newcommand{\defEfficiencyRate}[1]{
    \begin{definition}
    \label{#1}
     (Efficiency Rate) - the efficiency rate of a transaction $T_{i}$, denoted as  $E_{r}(T_{i})$, is based on how its execution time compares to all transactions executed within the execution environment. The efficiency rate is calculated based on the given formula:
     
    \[\textrm{$E_{r}(T_{i})$} =\frac{\textrm{$AVG(AVG(T_{1}),...,AVG(T_{n}))$}}{\textrm{$AVG(T_{i})$}}\]
