\label{mls:conclusion}
In summary, there are a multitude of opportunities to extend the current work into new realms. The prediction-based scheduler along with dynamic transaction reputation provides a system of consistency and scalability that can be extended into multi-level secure databases, linked databases, and other systems of databases. This contribution will provide a foundation for future researchers to extend into realms of database scheduling and transaction execution that have not been discussed before.
