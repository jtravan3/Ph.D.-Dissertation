This dissertation is dedicated to my wife, Michelle, who has been a constant source of support and encouragement during the challenges of graduate school and life. I am truly thankful for having you in my life. This work is also dedicated to my two sons, J.R. and James Ravan. I pray that this allows me the opportunity to give you the life that you deserve.
