\section{Prediction-Based Scheduling within Linked Databases}
\label{diss:linked_databases}

In this section we discuss the proposed work for implementing the comprehensive prediction-based scheduler (Chapters \ref{chap:prediction_based_scheduler} \& \ref{chap:multi_level_security}) into a linked-database environment. This section contains the proposal itself. The background information, problem definition, and existing research for the problem is outlined in Chapter \ref{chap:pbs_w_link_db}.

The final problem to attempt is the adaptation of the Prediction-based solution within a linked database environment. The challenges of scaling the solution to a linked database environment still needs to researched and the problems defined so that a proper solution can be presented. We believe there is a problem to be formally defined and analyzed through the lens of the Prediction-based solution.

Our proposal for linked database systems is much like the proposal outline in Section \ref{proposal:mls_database_scheduling}. Again, we propose researching the current academic environment for what is common practice among linked database systems, providing a solution based on the outcome of that research, verifying the accuracy, and working toward a viable prototype with initial results. Once again, since the bulk of the theoretical and simulation results have been accomplished in Chapter \ref{chap:prediction_based_scheduler} through the publication of \cite{ravan_ensuring_2020} we propose that this work consist of a submission to a conference.
