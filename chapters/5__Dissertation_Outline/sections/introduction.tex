\section{Introduction}
\label{diss:introduction}

The work needed for completion involves two problems that build upon the foundation of the existing work. In this chapter, we explain in detail the components needed for the completion of work. The first component is extending the prediction-based solution to multi-level secure databases by transitioning to a three-dimensional decision matrix. The second and final component is the work needed to dynamically manage the reputation of transactions executed within a prediction-based scheduler. We propose that a complete solution including both MLS databases and dynamic transaction reputation would satisfy all requirements needed for a Ph.D. All extensions listed in previous chapters will work towards prototypes for each problem in order to gather empirical results that prove the soundness of each solution.
