\section{Introduction}
\label{mls:introduction}
Now that we have an established system for elevating and demoting transactions based on their classification, we can use this system to provide a cover story for multi-level secure databases. The problem with multi-level secure databases is the possibility that there could be a covert channel allowing unauthorized access. The covert channel would provided the ability for a transaction of a lower security classification to access resources designed for a higher security classification. Existing research provides possible solutions but many of the solutions starve transactions of higher security classifications from gaining access to the resources needed (see Section \ref{mls:related_work}). With the prediction-based solution provided in Chapter \ref{chap:prediction_based_scheduler}, we can provide a cover story that determines locking priority based on the reputation of the transaction as a whole. This prevents the starvation of higher security classification transactions. By taking into consideration the security classification as a metric to calculate the reputation of the transaction, we also prevent the presence of covert channels.
