\section{Concluding Remarks}
\label{conclusion:concluding_remarks}
In this proposal, we have first analyzed the shortcomings to existing web service database transactions. These shortcomings involve the need for compensation transactions that, ultimately, are unnecessary overhead if A.C.I.D transaction properties can be leveraged. We analyzed the current solutions involving compensation transactions and maintaining consistency within a web service environment. As a result of this analysis, research and prototyping led to the development of a prediction-based solution. The final solution dynamically uses different concurrency control mechanisms depending on the attributes of the transaction. In the current work we have formally proven that this solution will ensure consistency by using dynamic concurrency control mechanisms (published in \cite{ravan_ensuring_2020}).

Second, we have proposed the needed extensions to the work that will address three additional areas of improvement. The first area is expanding the prediction-based solution to a multi-level secure database environment where multiple security classifications exist. This involves extending the existing two-dimensional categorization graph to a three-dimensional graph for all transactional attributes to prevent the existence of covert timing channels that can appear due to differing security classifications. By doing so we provide a cover story for the transactional environment that enables the promotion of high security transactions without the disclosure of a covert timing channel.

The final effort will be the final extension leveraging all phases of the dissertation. This effort will focus on the formal categorization of transactions before entering the prediction-based solution. In this effort we extract the extrinsic attributes from the intrinsic attributes to reveal transactional classes that can be identified and grouped. From there, those classes contain a reputation that is managed dynamically in order to grow with the environment. That then allows the categorization of transactions to be promoted and demoted based on the reputation.

% The final effort will be the final extension leveraging all solutions. This effort will use Snapshot Isolation for low-performing and malicious transactions. With the current and proposed research the overall contribution will ensure consistency among web service transactions. The contribution will also minimize the effects of malicious and poorly performing transactions within a web service environment.
