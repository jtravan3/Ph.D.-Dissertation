In this section we explain the full dissertation outline of milestones that were accomplished and their timing.

\subsection{Outline}

Table \ref{table:dissertation_outline} shows the dissertation in all of its phases. Research began in August of 2014 after becoming enrolled as a student. I met with Dr. Farkas initially and began working on the transactional-correctness portion of the work that transitioned into the prediction-based scheduler. This is the work detailed in Chapter \ref{chap:prediction_based_scheduler}. The work underwent multiple revisions until we were confident with the solution and the form it has now taken. The work was completed and submitted to IEEE Transactions on Services Computing in April of 2019. In January of 2020, we received a decision of Accepted with Minor Revisions. Revisions were made and that has now been published. This serves as the bulk of the work and also the foundation of the extensions proposed in Chapters \ref{chap:future_work}. Starting in February of 2020, we begin work on the dynamic transaction reputations. That work was completed in August of 2021 and submitted to ACM Transactions on Information Systems. We are still awaiting response.
