\section{Introduction}
\label{rep:introduction}

The work presented in Chapter \ref{chap:prediction_based_scheduler} provides a clean solution for providing consistent transactions in a web service environment where consistency is often lost due to certain transactional properties that are relaxed. In order to increase efficiency of many concurrent transactions, the transactional properties of atomicity and isolation are relaxed to prevent the overhead of locking. While this increases efficiency of concurrent transactions, this places the database at a much higher risk of reaching an inconsistent state where data needs to be repaired. In order to repair that data compensation transactions are created in order to reverse the effects of interleaved and aborted transactions. Chapter \ref{chap:prediction_based_scheduler} addresses this issue by the categorization of transactions based on attributes such as execution time and commit rate. The scope of the work in Chapter \ref{chap:prediction_based_scheduler} did not include the identification and classification of transactions and assumed a transactional category in order to prove the correctness of a solution. The work listed here in Chapter \ref{chap:dynamic_reputation} outlines how transactions are identified, classified, and then dynamically re-classified in order to have a solution that grows with a database system rather than a particular snapshot. All of this is made possible by tracking the reputation of a transaction throughout the system.
