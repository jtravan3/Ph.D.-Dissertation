There are many resources available for dynamic reputation management that shaped our understanding of the challenges of maintaining reputation of nodes/services. Many of the reputation systems were centered around maintaining a reputation in a distributed or decentralized system. These resources were \cite{clark_dynamic_2017}, \cite{de_paola_reputation_2008}, and  \cite{hu_reputation_2010}. While this helped our understand of the challenges of reputation management, our system would not experience the challenges associated with a decentralized trust management solution since the service and the database are both contained within the prediction-based scheduler itself. Other reputation management solutions were focused on the reputation or trustworthiness of web pages. Those solutions were presented in \cite{wang_research_2008} and \cite{melnikov_towards_2018}. These were also helpful but didn't address the reputation of database transactions directly which is the focus of the reputation of the prediction-based solution. The majority of reputation management systems are provided with the context of P2P or ad-hoc mobile networking in mind. Resources focused on dynamic reputations within networking environments are \cite{sun_dynamic_2019}, \cite{chiejina_dynamic_2014}, \cite{hu_reputation_2010}, and \cite{de_paola_reputation_2008}.

After studying the current environment of dynamic reputation systems, we believe this is a great opportunity to provide a dynamic reputation management solution particularly focused at database transactions within a web service environment.
