\section{Conclusion}
\label{rep:conclusion}

In closing we conclude that this extension of the prediction-based scheduling solution involves the identification of two unique problems: identifying a class of transactions and maintaining a dynamic reputation for that class of transactions. Identifying a class of transactions allows the prediction-based scheduler the ability to assign a categorization to transactions with common intrinsic attributes. Separating the intrinsic attributes from the extrinsic involves a flyweight modeling approach in order to properly model transaction classes. Once a an identification system has been developed for a class of transactions, we can then leverage existing dynamic reputation management systems outlined in Section \ref{rep:related_work}. This final extension of the prediction-based scheduler promotes a well-rounded solution that can be used and presented in open-source communities while future work is considered.
