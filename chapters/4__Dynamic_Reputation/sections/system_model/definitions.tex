\subsection{Definitions}
\label{rep:definitions}

There are multiple definitions within Chapters \ref{chap:prediction_based_scheduler} \& \ref{chap:multi_level_security} that will be used as a part of the VRM extension. There will also be changes to existing definitions and new definitions to properly implement and define the VRM solution.
