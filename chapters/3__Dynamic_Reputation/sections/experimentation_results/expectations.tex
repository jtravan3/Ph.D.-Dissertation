\subsection{Expectations}
\label{sec:anal_expectations}

Before executing the simulation, our definitions (see Section \ref{sec:definitions}) and system model (see Section \ref{sec:system_model}) led us to certain expectations that would come from the simulation. The overall expectation and claim from the dynamic reputation solution is that it provides a low overhead resource management solution with consistent scheduling. That claim is supported by the following three expectations:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item There will be greater reward and punishment from the dynamic reputation solution than from our previous prediction-based solution
    \item We will see the reward and punishment reflected in the rankings of the users and transactions
    \item The execution time will be comparable to both the previous prediction-based and \ac{2PL} scheduler to not indicate a serious overhead
\end{enumerate}
