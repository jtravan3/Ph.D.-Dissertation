\begin{abstract}
In this work, we build upon the prediction-based scheduler (see \cite{ravan_ensuring_2020}) by providing transactions the ability to promote or demote their reputation based on their execution history. Their reputations are built off of four rankings that the transactions build within the system: commit ranking, efficiency ranking, user ranking, and system ranking. With these rankings we can then establish dominance between the transactions executing and promote those with good rankings while transactions with bad rankings are demoted. After gathering empirical results we can conclude that systems with greater than 20\% conflicting transactions can benefit from the dynamic reputation scheduler over traditional 2PL or NoSQL schedulers.
